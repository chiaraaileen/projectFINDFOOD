  <p id="about"> Nowadays, many people have different preferences when it comes to food. <br> To keep everyone happy we have made an application which makes it suitable for people to find the food they were looking for. <br> For people with a specific kind of allergy like lactose, gluten or carbohydrate, we have made a whole menu where they can choose from. <br> But we are also vegan friendly in our application. <br> It is a nice tool to find a restaurant where they sell food which is not made of an animal. <br> When the user select his food preference he can choose of 4 different meals. <br> When he/she choose the meal he/she wants, the application will lead him to the restaurant which serves it. <br> Finally, the application did what it needs to do and make more people happy.  </p>
